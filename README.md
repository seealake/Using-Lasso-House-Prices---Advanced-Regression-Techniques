# Using Lasso To Predict House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

## This is my effort as a beginner to try to predict the perpetual competition of ["House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)) on kaggle, which I ended up with a score of 0.13118.
## I used Lasso Regression as my model prediction, with converting all features to numerical forms.
## If you would like to check my code and make some suggestions (if possible), please check out the file [lasso-to-predict-house-price.ipynb](./lasso-to-predict-house-price.ipynb), with the file [submission.csv](./submission.csv) as the final submission. Thank you for leaving any suggestions!
